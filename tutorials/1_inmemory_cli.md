This code defines an in-memory CLI to-do list application. Here are the step by step instructions:

1. First, the code imports the `dataclass` and `asdict` functions from the `dataclasses` module.
2. It defines three constant integers `TASK_ONGOING`, `TASK_COMPLETED`, and `TASK_DELETED`, representing the state of a task.
3. It defines a class named `Task` that represents a single task in the to-do list. The `Task` class is a dataclass and has three attributes: `name` (str), `state` (int), and `id` (int).
4. It defines a function named `dict` that returns a dictionary representation of a `Task` object. The dictionary is created using the `asdict` function, and any non-integer or non-string values are converted to strings.
5. It sets a global integer variable `TASK_COUNTER` to 0.
6. It defines several functions for creating, updating, reading, and deleting tasks in the to-do list. These functions include:
    1. `handle_create_task`: creates a new task with the specified name and default state of `TASK_ONGOING`, assigns a unique ID to the task, and adds it to the `tasks` dictionary.
    2. `handle_update_task_name`: updates the name of a task with the specified ID in the `tasks` dictionary.
    3. `handle_update_task_state`: updates the state of a task with the specified ID in the `tasks` dictionary.
    4. `handle_read_task`: returns a `Task` object with the specified ID from the `tasks` dictionary.
    5. `handle_read_task_all`: returns a generator that yields all tasks in the `tasks` dictionary.
    6. `handle_delete_task`: removes the task with the specified ID from the `tasks` dictionary.
    7. `handle_help`: prints a help message that explains how to use the CLI to interact with the to-do list.
    8. `handle_view_tasks`: prints all tasks in the to-do list, including their ID, name, and state.
7. It defines several regular expressions to match various CLI commands, such as creating a new task, updating a task's name, completing a task, etc.
8. It defines a `loop` function that takes a dictionary of tasks as an argument and enters a loop that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a command and performs the appropriate action based on the command. The `loop` function uses the regular expressions to match commands, calls the appropriate handler function, and prints a message to confirm the action.
9. Finally, it checks if the code is being run as the `__main__` module, and if so, calls the `loop` function with the dictionary of tasks loaded from the JSON file using the get_json function.

That's it! This code implements a basic to-do list application.
