This code defines a CLI persistent to-do list application that uses a SQLite database to store tasks and a JSON file as backup. Here are the step by step instructions:

1. First, the code imports the `dataclass` and `asdict` functions from the `dataclasses` module.
2. It defines three constant integers `TASK_ONGOING`, `TASK_COMPLETED`, and `TASK_DELETED`, representing the state of a task.
3. It defines a class named `Task` that represents a single task in the to-do list. The `Task` class is a dataclass and has three attributes: `name` (str), `state` (int), and `id` (int).
4. It defines a function named `dict` that returns a dictionary representation of a `Task` object. The dictionary is created using the `asdict` function, and any non-integer or non-string values are converted to strings.
5. It sets a global integer variable `TASK_COUNTER` to 0.
6. It defines variables and functions requred to allow persistence of the data in a JSON file:
    - It sets a string variable `TASK_JSON_PATH` to "tasks.json".
    - It defines a function named `get_json` to read the tasks from the JSON file, converting the JSON data into `Task` objects. If the JSON file does not exist, the function creates it with an empty dictionary. The json.load method reads the JSON data from the file and converts it into a dictionary, which is then converted into a dictionary of `Task` objects.
    - It defines a function named `set_json` to write the tasks to the JSON file, converting the `Task` objects into a dictionary. The json.dump method writes the dictionary of `Task` objects to the JSON file, converting each object into a dictionary first.
7. It defines imports, functions, classes, and setup required to allow persistence of the data in a SQLite database:
    - Import necessary packages: `create_engine`, `Column`, `Integer`, `String`, `ForeignKey`, `declarative_base`, `sessionmaker`, and `Session`.
    - Create an instance of create_engine with the desired database's location as an argument. In this case, the database is named `tasks.sqlite`.
    - Create an instance of declarative_base class and store it in a variable named `BASE`. This instance will be used as a base class for our database models.
    - Define a new class named `TaskState_DB` that extends the `BASE` class. The `__tablename__` attribute specifies the name of the table in the database. Two columns are defined: `id` and `name`.
        - `id` is of type `Integer` and will act as the primary key.
        - `name` is of type `String` and can store up to 100 characters.
    - Define a new class named `Task_DB` that extends the `BASE` class. The `__tablename__` attribute specifies the name of the table in the database. Three columns are defined: `id`, `name`, and `state`.
        - `id` is of type Integer and will act as the primary key.
        - `name` is of type `String` and can store up to 200 characters.
        - `state` is of type `Integer` and is a foreign key to the `id` column of the `TaskState_DB` table.
    - Define a method named `get_task` in the `Task_DB` class that returns an instance of the `Task` class with the `id`, `name`, and state attributes set to the corresponding values of the instance.
    - Call `BASE.metadata.create_all(ENGINE, checkfirst=True)` to create the tables in the database if they do not already exist.
    - Iterate over a list of task states, each represented as a `name` and an `id`.
        - For each task state, query the `TaskState_DB` table to see if a row with the corresponding `id` already exists. If not, add a new row with the `id` and `name`.
        - Commit new items to the database if available.
    - Define a function `set_json_from_db` that takes a `Session` object as an argument.
        - Inside the function, query the `Task_DB` table and create a dictionary named tasks that maps task ids to instances of the `Task` class created using the `get_task` method.
        - Call a function named `set_json` and pass it the tasks dictionary as an argument.
8. It defines several functions for creating, updating, reading, and deleting tasks in the to-do list. These functions include:
    1. `handle_create_task`: creates a new task with the specified name and default state of `TASK_ONGOING`, assigns a unique ID to the task, adds it to the SQLite database, and writes the updated dictionary to the JSON file.
    2. `handle_update_task_name`: updates the name of a task with the specified ID in the SQLite database, and writes the updated dictionary to the JSON file.
    3. `handle_update_task_state`: updates the state of a task with the specified ID in the SQLite database, and writes the updated dictionary to the JSON file.
    4. `handle_read_task`: returns a `Task` object with the specified ID from the SQLite database.
    5. `handle_read_task_all`: returns a generator that yields all tasks in the SQLite database.
    6. `handle_delete_task`: removes the task with the specified ID from the SQLite database, deletes the corresponding record in the SQLite database, and writes the updated dictionary to the JSON file.
    7. `handle_help`: prints a help message that explains how to use the CLI to interact with the to-do list.
    8. `handle_view_tasks`: prints all tasks in the to-do list, including their ID, name, and state.
9. It defines several regular expressions to match various CLI commands, such as creating a new task, updating a task's name, completing a task, etc.
10. It defines a `loop` function that takes a SQLite database session as an argument and enters a loop that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a command and performs the appropriate action based on the command. The `loop` function uses the regular expressions to match commands, calls the appropriate handler function, and prints a message to confirm the action.
11. Finally, it checks if the code is being run as the `__main__` module, and if so, calls the `loop` function with the SQlite database session.

That's it! This code implements a basic to-do list application with a persistent storage mechanism using a SQLite database to store tasks and a JSON file as backup.
