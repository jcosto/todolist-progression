# To Do List App - Implementation Progression
To-do list project; progression from CLI application to Web Application to Cloud Service for absolute beginners. The purpose of this repository is to provide beginners to full-stack development a step-by-step process of the progression from absolute basic command-line applicatin to a production-ready cloud service. This aims introduce new concepts at each stage which, while not explained in detaill, should provide inspiration for further self-learning.

Phase 1: CLI app to Web app
1. CLI app, in-memory storage
2. CLI app, JSON file persistent storage
3. CLI app, SQLite persistent storage, JSON file backup
4. Standard HTML Web app, SQLite persistent storage, JSON file backup
5. Bootstrap Web app, SQLite persistent storage, JSON file backup

Phase 2: App Management and Monitorng
1. Request Logging, Logging management
2. User Management, SQLite
3. CSRF Form Protection

Phase 3: Cloud app,  Load Testing
1. Cloud deployment with SSL
2. User Management, Google OAuth
3. Cloud database persistent storage, database implementation rollover
4. Cloud message broker
